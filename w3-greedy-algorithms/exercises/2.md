# Exercise 2

You are a software engineer working for a navigation technology company that provides route planning services for delivery vehicles. The company has a network of roads, each with a specific distance and traffic data. The goal is to design an efficient algorithm that can find the shortest route from a starting point (source) to a destination (target) for the delivery vehicles, considering factors like road distance, traffic congestion, and road conditions.

1. Implement an algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm should find the shortest path from the starting point to all destinations.
2. Evaluate the time complexity of your implementation. How does the time complexity change when using different data structures (e.g., priority queues or simple arrays)?
3. Conduct a performance test of your algorithm on a graph with different sizes (e.g., 10, 50, 100 destinations) and report the execution time. What does the performance tell you about the scalability of the algorithm?
