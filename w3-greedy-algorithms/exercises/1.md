# Exercise 1

You are working as a software engineer for an e-commerce platform that needs to optimize product packaging for customers placing bulk orders. The challenge is to select products that can fit into a set of boxes with specific capacities, ensuring the maximum value for each box without exceeding its capacity.

### Questions

1. Describe the key characteristics of the greedy algorithm design paradigm. How might it work for solving optimization problem like this challenge?
2. How would we apply the greedy algorithm to solve the e-commerce packaging problem? What greedy strategy would you use?
3. If the e-commerce platform grows significantly, and the number of products increases, how do you think the performance of the greedy algorithm will be affected? Would you recommend this algorithm for large-scale problems?
