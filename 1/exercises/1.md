# Exercise 1

Imagine you are a software engineer tasked with designing and optimizing a Library Management System for a large public
library. The library manages a vast collection of books, digital resources, and multimedia items. The system needs to
efficiently manage inventory, track book checkouts and returns, handle reservations, and allow users to search for books
and other materials in real-time.
The system should support key operations like:

- Adding new books and resources
- Searching for books by title, author, genre, or availability
- Checking out and returning books
- Reserving books that are currently checked out

As the library’s collection grows and the number of patrons increases, the system must scale to handle more data and
provide fast, efficient responses to user requests.

Based on the insights gained from this system, please respond to the following questions:

1. Discuss what data structures would you choose to store and manage the following information in the system?
    - Book details (e.g., title, author, ISBN, genre, availability status)
    - User accounts (e.g., name, membership details, book checkout history)
    - Book reservations (e.g., reserved books, patron details)
      Justify why did you choose these data structures?
2. Imagine you are implementing a search algorithm to find books based on a user's query (e.g., by title, author, or
   genre). Which search algorithm would you choose to implement for searching books? Justify your answer.
3.
    1. Formulate the recurrence relation that represents the time complexity of your chosen search algorithm. Also,
       express the time complexity of the algorithm using Big-O notation.
    2. Using the Master Theorem or the Iterative Method, provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to analyze the given
       recurrence relation. Ensure the explanation includes an accurate final determination of the overall time
       complexity. Additionally, include an analysis of the space complexity for the search algorithm you have selected.
