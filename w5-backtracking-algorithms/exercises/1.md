# Exercise 1

You are working on an advanced scheduling system for a university that must allocate lecture halls for classes without conflicts. The system
needs to ensure that no two classes are scheduled in the same hall at the same time and that professors are not double-booked for
overlapping lectures.

1. How would you define the backtracking algorithms, and why are they a suitable choice for solving scheduling problems in the given
   scenario? Support your discussion with suitable examples.
2. How can the backtracking algorithms be applied to systematically assign classes to lecture halls while ensuring no two classes are
   scheduled in the same hall at the same time and no professor is double-booked?
3. In the given scenario, constraints include class timings, professor availability, and lecture hall capacity. How would you ensure these
   constraints are satisfied at each step of the backtracking process? Also provide examples demonstrating the same?
