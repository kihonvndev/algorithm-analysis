# Exercise 2

You are a logistics manager for a startup specializing in delivering custom gift baskets. Each basket must meet specific weight constraints and
maximize the value of included items to meet customer preferences. Additionally, you must select the right combination of gifts from an
inventory based on the customer's budget and weight limitations.

1. Knapsack Problem Implementation
   1. Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and calculate its time complexity.
   2. The program should input a list of items (each with a weight and value), a maximum weight capacity, and output the optimal subset
      of items maximizing total value.
2. Sum of Subsets Problem Implementation
   1. Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sum of Subsets Problem and calculate its time complexity.
   2. The program should input a target sum and a list of item values, outputting all subsets that achieve the target sum.
3. Integrate the Solutions: Combine the two solutions to ensure selected items satisfy both constraints: maximizing value while matching specific preferences
   or a target total value.
