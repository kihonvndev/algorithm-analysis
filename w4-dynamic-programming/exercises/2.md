# Exercise 2

A nationwide sales team needs to optimize the route for a salesperson who must visit multiple regional offices. Starting from a designated location, the salesperson must visit each office exactly once and return to the starting point. You have been assigned to develop an efficient solution to this routing problem. The following tasks explore strategies for determining an optimal route:

1. Implement a solution to solve this routing problem. The program should accept a list of regional offices and the travel costs between each pair of offices. The output must be the minimum total cost required for the salesperson to visit every office exactly once and return to the starting location.
2. Test your solution with varying numbers of regional offices (from 5 to 15) to examine how the algorithm scales as the problem size increases.
3. Evaluate the efficiency of your implementation compared to a brute-force approach that generates all possible route permutations. Analyze the strengths and limitations of the chosen strategy for solving this type of optimization problem.
