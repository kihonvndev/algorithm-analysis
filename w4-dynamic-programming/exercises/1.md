# Exercise 1

An international airline seeks to optimize its flight network to ensure the shortest possible travel times across its global routes. As the number of airports and passenger demand continue to grow, the IT department must design a system capable of computing the shortest paths between all pairs of airports while using minimal computational resources. To address these routing challenges, consider the following discussion questions:

1. How can the shortest travel times between any two airports be determined?
2. What are the key advantages of the proposed algorithm compared to alternative approaches when applied to large-scale, multi-airport networks? Support your discussion with specific examples.
3. Implement the proposed algorithm in a programming language of your choice. Discuss how the solution scales as additional airports and flight connections are incorporated into the system.
